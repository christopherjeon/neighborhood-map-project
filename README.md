# Neighborhood Map Project
This .zip file contains various files that create a single-page application featuring a map of Vancouver.

Using information from Google Maps and Foursquare APIs, I have added markers to identify popular restaurants in Vancouver.

## Prerequisites
* KnockOutJS
* jQuery
* Google Maps API
* Foursquare API

## Getting Started
Download the .zip file, which has:
* __index.html__
* '__js__' folder which contains the JavaScript file, __app.js__
* '__css__' folder which contains the CSS file, __stylesheet.css__

Open each file to examine its contents and comments in the code.

## Running The Script

In order to access the single-page application, open the index.html file in your browser. From there you should be able to:
* View each restaurant's markers
* Access information such as rating and price by clicking on a restaurant

## Built With
* [Atom](https://atom.io)
* [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/)
